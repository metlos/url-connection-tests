== URL Connection Tests

Java 8 seems to not be able to work with certain SSL certificates.

This is a super simple test project that tries to download 2 urls:

* https://cloudflare.krejci.pw - fails, possibly because it has TLS 1.3 enabled
* https://letsencrypt.krejci.pw - works

To try it out, make sure you're using Java 8 (`java -version`) and then just:

```
mvn clean verify
```

If you want to see some more diagnostic information from the JVM about the handling of the connection, do:
```
mvn clean verify -Pdiagnostic
```

Interestingly both sites seem to be downloadable just fine by running the same steps with Java 9 or later.
